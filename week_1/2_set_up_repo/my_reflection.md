## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
Go to https://github.com/, login and press the green button labeled "create new repository" on the lower right section of the page. Give it a short but descriptive name, add a description if you like, and choose the type of license you would like to use (for more info on what license to use refer to ). Now, in order the clone your newly created repo to your computer you have two choices.
1. Open the Github app we downloaded and set up in the previous section. On the left sidebar you should fin two sections: "This computer" and "Github.com". Below the latter you should your user name, click on it and your github repositories will be listed on the right. Just look for the one you want to clone and click "Clone to computer". Done!
2. Open your terminal. The first thing we want to do is go to the folder (terminal calls it change directory) where we want to clone our new repo. So we use the command "cd". Once there we need to ask the git to clone the repo (git clone), and for that we also need to tell it where it can find it. Thus, this is how our command ends up looking: $ git clone git@github.com:username/reponame.git. All set!


* Describe what open source means
Open source is a term used to refer to software which's source code has been made available for any person to download and modify, thus creating new version of that software with different capabilities and sometimes even different purposes.

* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Open Source is an amazing thing, the idea of people sharing their hours of hard work, frustration and satisfaction for no other purpose than furthering knowledge or putting something out there that will improve people's lives seems like a big deal. Plus, in a world where more than once propietary software businesses have abused their users, it is necessary to have options to their platforms or services
I started writing that open source "doesn't generate any negative feelings but I wouldn't go as far as calling it utopia". Thinking it over I have to say utopia in on itself or not, in an ideal world information would flow freely, providing everyone with the opportunity of learning and thriving.
However, I don't know if we should aim for that drastically right away. We don't live in utopia, software development is hard work, some people put heart and soul into what they do which to me merits reward. At the end of the day it's their job and they have to eat and pay the bills like anyone else, right? I think a healthy combo of the different types of software and reasonable business pratices is where we should be right now.

* Assess the importance of using licenses
I believe licenses are important in that they allow, in a practical way, for content to be shared, learnt from, improved upon and used to complement other projects or spark new ideas. All that while protecting the rights of the author, whether he wants to keep that software from being used commercially or just be acknowledged as its creator 

* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
The concept of cloning was solidified and luckily I did not struggle with it since it was covered quite thoroughly in the previous section.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
With danger of repeating myself :) the previous section was pretty clear and helpful on cloning so together with the material in this section it was more than enough to get through.
