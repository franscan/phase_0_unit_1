I'm trying to order a little bit the mess that I have so here is my e-mail for week 1 that I never sent:
My name is francisco as you can see in the header. I was born and raised in Buenos AIres but I'm currently in Sydney, Australia. For some more info you can go to this page. To see some of my favorite websites you can check out part 8 of week one here, and my learning style is is multimodal, with a predominance of aural and kinesthetic .

James, I never answered to your question about being in Chicago. As I said in the beginning of the email, I'm in Sydney right now but I'll be getting there the first week of June. I'll be living at my sister's place a couple of blocks from Horner Park, it'd be great to meet before classes start.
Looking forward to meet you all!
Francisco

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.
