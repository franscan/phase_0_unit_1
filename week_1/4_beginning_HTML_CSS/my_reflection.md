## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
So far everything seems to make sense (unless I'm not really understanding what the hell I'm doing :), but then again so far it has all been pretty core concepts, so maybe down the road there are some things waiting for me to not make sense!

* What seems good and bad about HTML?
It seems good its ability to translate content into a more visually structured presentation which was probably the reason it was created in the first place, but it is limited and what it is able to do with that content

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
Rather than concepts solidifying I was introduced into CSS and to it works with HTML, and some of the main features of it.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I didn't write down specific resources, I googled here and there when I wanted to do something but I didn't know the specific name of a command such as when the font family applied to headings didn't override the bold format given by the HTML automatic styling, so I had to resort to font weight.
