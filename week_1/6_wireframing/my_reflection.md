## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
I learnt to think about design as a problem process, and not just a creation process. Also that it has much broader applications than one would initially think.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
I didn't get to work much on wireframing, I just did a rough distribution of content to be able to advance qith the exercises but I love design and user experience. First of all, I love beautiful crafted objects or displays. Color, symmetry, type, is just food for soul. But more importantly, if you may have the most responsive, useful website/app in the world, but when people see it they run away screaming, all your effort was in vain. What we develop needs to engage the user and work, it needs to address form and function equally.

* What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
I just asked myself what the objective of the websites analyzed were, and how their wireframe approached that objective, and how successful that approach was being.

* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
I figured out the problem I was having with my hovering pseudoclass infecting all my text! I had forgot to close my the tags on the sidebar buttons!! silly mistake :) http://bit.ly/1nRCUsK

* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
I added the wirify extension to my browser, first step into working with wireframing applications

* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
Materials seemed pretty straightforward, I'll need to go over it again to be able to design my own process in wireframing and see what applies and works.

* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
All of it, exporting my wireframed screeshots ans assembling them in PS, analyzing the websites and try to figure out what intentions are behind the layour of the page. 

* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
None, I like design and eventhough I couldnt work in illustrator or any actual tools due to time constraints I'm looking forward to this kind of tasks
