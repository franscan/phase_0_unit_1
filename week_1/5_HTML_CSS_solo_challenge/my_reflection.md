## 5. [HTML/CSS Solo Challenge](5_HTML_CSS_solo_challenge/readme.md) Reflection

* What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
I had looked it up before but had forgotten how not to underline links: http://www.pageresource.com/html/link3.htm
How to center my website in the web browser? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2279519/how-to-get-main-div-container-to-align-to-centre


* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
My text was getting behind my picture and I have no idea how I fixed it.
Regular text is adopting the links hover pseudoclass behaviour and I was not able to fix it
I created an all encompassing div because I thought that way relative positioning would be done in reference to subdivs, and absolute positioning would be done in reference to the master div i made. However, when I trying the positioning and learning about it, I found out that absolute positioning did not take as reference my master div but the whole browser, repositioning awkwardly if I changed my zoom.

* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
Well, pretty much all the skills included in the competencies but not anything unrelated. I did write down to, when I have some time, look up a plugin to launch a color scheme/picker within sublime.

* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
I think I understood all of the content, but I don't feel like this one challenge has made me fluent at all, I need more practice in order te be able to visualize more automatically the changes I make will behave

* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy? * Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I didn't find some parts enjoyable and some tedious. To me, it was a whole process where it was enjoyable bringing the webpage to life and woirking out the kinks but it was tedious, or rather annoying, not being able to figure out the solution to those things that didn't behave the way i wanted them to
