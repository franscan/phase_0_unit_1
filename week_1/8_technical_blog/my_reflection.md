## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: http://franscan.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?
I didn't enjoy it thoroughly as it felt a bit of an overlap with the wireframing questions and I couldn't take my time to write it in a nice way.
