## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
I think this section gives much more than two concepts. You have web sites, web apps, web server, IP, domains, DNS server, HTML. In spite of getting further useful explanations and details on all of them they were not new things for me. The one thing that I do not know but have marked to read for later, is the article explaining the reason for the 24 to 48 hour delay of info updating in DNS servers.

* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
Well, I'm not sure I know enough about HTML to answer this question or if I'm getting the point. Considering what was done in this section, all I can think of is you should make sure you save the file in the right directory with the appropiate file extension and check your sintax.

* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
Relieved that the exercise had gone down without a hitch!

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
This was another instance of practicing adding, committing and pushing as I started using this method for reflections in the previous section after github crashed when I tried to save and lost my whole reflection.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Honestly, I'm just trying to catch up so I'm limiting myself to the materials provided, especially if they provided all the necessary info
