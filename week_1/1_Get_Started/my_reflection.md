## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

I had trouble with the password caching instructions (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git). I already had the credential helper installed so I skipped the download bit but thought I still had to move it (step that I should've also skipped) but my attempts to do so kept returning error messages that stack overflow solutions did not solve. It gave quite some perspective on the need to be very patient and not be discouraged, and eventhough the mistake was really silly when I was able to move on I got great satisfaction.
I also struggled with myself in general. I am used to a very linear and directed learning process but here I encountered  materials where some of them partly repeated information, or where the commands didn't always work, and where each material linked to sources and additional info. It was difficult for me to choose where to stop reading or to decide to move on when something didn't work or make sense but wasn't important either.



* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 

Git is software that allows an individual or a group of people working on a project of any kind (software, finance, publishing, etc.) to record and keep track of all the changes that are made to any document. Having every change recorded is benefitial in that it allows to see your progress and correct errors or go back to an old version. If you're working as part of a team, it keeps everyone up to date on the rest of teams changes, prevents duplicates, confusion regarding which version is the latest, and simplifies collaboration in general. 
It is important to note that this software is based on your computer and all the changes you record are initially only saved in it. This is fine when you work by yourself but when you work with others you need a way to share your changes. This is where Github comes in. Github is an online (internet based) node or....well hub, where every member of a team records the changes they make in a master document. Potentially, a team could open their project to the community, enabling anyone to make changes and submit them for consideration. Github is the way to unlock that git's potential to work on things simultaneously, be notified when someone is modifying the same content as you are and every other aspect that comes with several users working in an integrated way




* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.

Version control is the act or process of saving and keeping record of all the changes you make to a document. There is software designed to this end as we have mentioned before, such as git. Github works as a central remote repo where one or many people can upload their project and have a centralized node where all changes are implemented and checked. Furthermore, it provides a GUI that performs tasks such as creating repos, adding files and branching without using the command line, and you can edit the files directly from Github.




* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?

Version control is used by programmers for a numbers of reasons. If a team is working on a big project, it can be split into several smaller projects assigned to independent teams, all of them submitting their changes to a master complete version of the project. Also, in case of a bug, it could help trace what change caused its ocurrence. If two people were to modify the same file, with version control they would know of that situation and see what each did, in order to select the best version of the file. Finally, it could potentially help understand why a change was made or at least contact the person who made ir. Of course it makes sense: it saves time, allows for people to collaborate even if they can't meet face to face and should produce a higher quality product.



* What doesn't make sense? What does?

So far, pretty much everything made sense in the end, in terms of what I was doing and what was the purpose of doing it. The part that escapes me sometimes is how I am doing it or, in other words, what some parts of some commands mean and I didn't always have the time to properly research it.
