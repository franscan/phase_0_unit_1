        <p>THIS IS OUR AWESOME PAIRING SITE</p>
        <p> If pair programming feels threatening at first, you’re normal. Two developers, one keyboard… yuck. If you’re like me, you want your own space, and you get a kind of rhythm going with mid-compile checking email and stuff. Taking that away during pair programming time sounds like it would be incredibly awkward.

Oddly, it just isn’t. When I first tried pairing intentionally, as a practice, it came rather naturally and wasn’t bad at all. It was actually fun.</p>

<p>Lui, Chan, and Nosek performed two experiments in design tasks: (1) Procedural Solution Tasks; and (2) Deductive Problem Solving. In 2002–2003, 15 part-time third year undergraduate students at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong and full-time industrial programmers were invited to complete 15 multiple-choice questions on five procedural algorithmic tasks. “Analyzing a flowchart is a fundamental skill required in programming design”. The key processes of Coordinate Measuring Machines, extreme programming and pair programming were introduced to the students before the experiment. In the controlled experiment, the subjects were randomly divided into five pairs and five individuals. Because of the “small sample size”, the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to “statistically evaluate the results”. The pairs outperformed the individuals significantly in both the tests for elapsed time and number of resubmissions with a p-value of .03. Ten of the fifteen subjects agreed to participate in the second experiment. In this experiment, the students were asked to solve deduction problems that help to examine a developer’s ability to “cope with complexity”. The subjects first worked in pairs on one problem and then worked individually on the next problem. The Wilcoxon rank sum test proved that the pairs outperformed individuals with respect to elapsed time and number of resubmissions with a p-value of .014 and .01, respectively.[11]</p>

<p>Nosek performed an experiment on 15 full-time system programmers from a program trading firm. Ten programmers worked in pairs whereas five programmers worked individually. “The subjects were asked to write a script that performs a database consistency check (DBCC) with the output for errors to be written to a file” and were given 45 minutes for the task. The groups were scored on the readability and functionality of the code produced. The pairs scored 30% higher on the readability of code and 23% higher on the functionality of code. These results provided evidence that pair programming improves the problem solving process.[12]</p>


<p><a id = "one">Nawrocki</a> performed an experiment on 15 fourth-year students to evaluate the relative effort between pair programmers and solo programmers. He used the concept of “Relative Effort Afforded by Pairs” (REAP) for his experiments. The group was divided into five pairs and five individuals. All the programmers had “two years of formal study in C and C++”. The subjects were asked to write four programs. “These were programs for finding the mean and standard deviation of samples of numerical data, finding the linear regression parameters, counting the number of lines in a program and counting the total program LOC.” His experiments revealed that the individual programmers and the pairs took the same amount of time to finish the first three programs which meant that REAP was 100%. Thus, Nawrocki concluded that pair programming was not as efficient as had been reported by Laurie Williams and John Nosek.[13]</p>
