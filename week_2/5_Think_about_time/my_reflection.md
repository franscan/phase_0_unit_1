# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
I think my biggest time management during Phase 0 is my education history and my mindset. In my education, things came easy initially so I never built self discipline and study methodologies, plus I usually had linient teachers. Nowadays, I feel really strongly ‘the resistance’ mentioned in one of the blog posts. This in turns fires my stress and anxiety and I get caught in a negative feedback loop. I know most people will say my job, my social life, my hobbies, or whatever. Honestly, my biggest challenge is inside me.

* How will you combat that? 
I plan to combat it by trying to break down weeks as much as possible, so they don't seem so daunting and keeping my anxiety and insecurity in check. Also, I want to be more mindful of what's going on with myself.

* What techniques will you try?
I want to start meditating daily, something I have already tried but this time I will go for the BJ Fogg method, and meditate 5-10 minutes when I get out of the shower.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
My plan is to be organized and systematic. Once I catch up I will aim to do 20% of the week's work every day. I will only continue if I am absolutely in the zone and enjoying myself. If I feel I should be doing more I'll just practice a bit of command line or sublime. If any day I'm really doing bad work I will do only 10% and make up for it the two remaining days. Under normal circumstances weekends will be for reviewing and casual reading on complementary topics. Also, if the shoulder allows, I will go back to swim twice a week.
