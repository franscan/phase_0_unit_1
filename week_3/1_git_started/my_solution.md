2) git commit -m "lorem ipsum"

## Release 5: Reflection

<!--What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
//Didnt face any major problems
//
//
//What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
//Went here http://www.siteground.com/tutorials/git/commands.htm just to refresh some details of the commands
//
//
//What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
//I'm not sure if I get completely the tracking process. From this exercise it would seem that "add" works both to include a new file in the index or to include the changes in an already tracked file. If that is correct, that is what I figured out.

//
//
//Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
//Nothing new this time
//
//
//How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
//I feel pretty confident. I know I have a way to go in learning more complex commands
//
//
//Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
//It was prettu straightforward. Nor tedious nor a joyride.
